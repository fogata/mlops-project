Using Creative Commons Public Licenses

Creative Commons public licenses provide a standard set of terms and
conditions that creators and other rights holders may use to share
original works of authorship and other material subject to copyright

exhaustive, and do not form part of our licenses.


- By using a Creative Commons public license, you agree to the
  terms and conditions of that license.

- You should read and understand the terms and conditions of the
  license you choose before applying it. You should also secure all
  rights necessary before applying the license so that the license
  is effective.

- Creative Commons licenses are irrevocable. You cannot stop
  someone from using the licensed material under the terms of the
  license, so long as they comply with those terms.

- Creative Commons is not a party to its public licenses. However,
  Creative Commons may elect to apply one of its public licenses to
  material it publishes and in those instances will be considered
  the "Licensor."
